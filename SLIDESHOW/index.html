        This collection of illustrations began in 2018 when I took off
        traveling, spending time in my motherland â€“ Poland. Following a brief
        stint as a chef in Devon, I considered a permanent move to Poland,
        hoping to find work in an inspiring kitchen. Over the course of that
        year my home became Krakow, where I visited many restaurants, cafes and
        bars to learn about traditional Polish cuisine. But although my
        experiences were abundant, the local cuisine didn't fully grab me. And
        it soon became clear that poverty and homelessness was rife. Brexit was
        just around the corner. With a further situation brewing at home, I
        returned sooner than expected.
        <br /><br />
        In order to capture those rare moments, I wrote about and illustrated my
        food experiences and many of the illustrations here are a record of that
        time.
        <br /><br />
        Since returning I've continued to illustrate food, and find it useful to
        help me deal with the surreal, turbulant and ever-changing world I now
        find myself in. But there are times when motivation eludes me. So I hope
        that by giving these illustrations a permanent home I will discover my
        illustration-mojo once again and add to this collection. Perhaps one day
        I'll add a food-writing section too. And just <em>maybe</em> I'll be
        inspired enough to begin this process over again. <br /><br />Smacznego!
